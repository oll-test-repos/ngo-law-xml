    <heading>Purpose.</heading>
    <text>The purpose of the Respite Care Program is to provide short-term, periodic and temporary care for individuals with developmental or functional disabilities in or out of their homes by qualified care workers in order to relieve the family or informal caregiver. This temporary care of the adult or child with a developmental or functional disability provides a period of rest and renewal for the family while contributing to maintaining the individual in the community, enabling the individual to live in a family or family-like environment, or assisting the individual in achieving a greater level of independence. Respite care is provided at planned intervals, in a time of crisis, or on an as-needed basis. This is not an entitlement program.</text>
