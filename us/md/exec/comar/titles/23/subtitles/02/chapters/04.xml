      <text>The purpose of this chapter is to advance the best interest of the State with respect to State tidal wetlands, including preserving the rights of riparian owners.</text>

    <para>
      <num>B.</num>
      <text>The State holds State tidal wetlands in both a proprietary capacity and in sovereign trust for the benefit of the people of Maryland. In determining whether to issue a State tidal wetlands license, the Board of Public Works has the same discretion that any owner has in deciding whether to grant to another an interest in the owner’s property.</text>
    </para>
    <para>
      <num>C.</num>
      <text>In applying this chapter to determine whether issuing a State tidal wetland’s license is in the State’s best interest, it is the public policy of the State, taking into account varying ecological, economic, developmental, recreational, and aesthetic values, to preserve the wetlands and prevent their despoliation and destruction.</text>

    <heading>Scope.</heading>
    <para>
      <num>A.</num>
      <text>This chapter sets forth the procedures of the Board of Public Works for the licensing of all dredging, filling, or altering of State tidal wetlands. This includes the construction, reconstruction, or repair of structures, or of nonstructural shoreline stabilization measures, on State tidal wetlands.</text>
    </para>
    <para>
      <num>B.</num>
      <text>A license issued under this chapter does not convey ownership of lands or the affected air space, or diminish the full and free use and enjoyment by the public of the tidal waters of the State.</text>
    </para>
    <para>
      <num>C.</num>
      <text>This chapter does not change the title to submerged lands conveyed to private owners by the State or its predecessors.</text>

    <para>
      <num>D.</num>
      <text>This chapter does not set forth the complete range of Board of Public Works’ fiduciary and proprietary responsibilities relating to private uses of State wetlands. The Board of Public Works may, among other things, address these matters through easement, lease, deed, or other instrument to protect the State’s interests or to convey an interest in State wetlands.</text>
